The extra server will enable us to have redundancy in addition to lessen congestion due to the addition of a load balancer.
This may enhance the overall performance of the website.
The load balancer will use the round robin distribution set of rules. This set of rules works by assigning requests to the servers
relying on the wide variety of the request, oddly variety requests visit server 1 and lightly numbered requests go to server 2.
The load balancer enables an lively-lively setup, this is to lessen the congestion and lessen the burden of the first server.
In an energetic-energetic setup both servers will work at the equal time while in a passive-passive installation one of the servers will be on standby
for redundancy.
The primary-reproduction cluster commonly gets up to date every time the master database gets updated. information from the master gets replicated to the slave.
The duplicate node is based on data from the primary node. That is due to the fact replication is occasion-driven.
The SPOF are:
- the connection of the client to the net
- the connection of the internet servers to the net
- malfunction in the load balancer
The server installation has no firewalls and does not use HTTPS making it at risk of assaults.
there's also no tracking so it would be hard to are expecting peak hours, to discover while congestion occurs and why the congestion happens as nicely
as permit quicker healing from congestion.
