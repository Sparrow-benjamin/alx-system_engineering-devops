Issue summary:


On May 4, 2023, from 10:00 a.m.:
00h to 12h:
00 PM PDT, a serious outage has occurred for users of our web application. The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in our load balancer, which resulted in a large number of requests being routed to a single backend server. During the downtime, users experience slow load times, error messages, and intermittent app access. Approximately 60% of our users were affected by the outage.

00:00:
The problem was first discovered when monitoring alerts showed a significantly increased error rate. - ten:
05:00:
The engineering team was alerted to the issue and began investigating the potential causes.

3 pm:
Initial investigations focused on application servers and databases, but found no issues.

30h:
The load balancer was identified as a possible cause and further investigation revealed a misconfiguration.

00:00:
The engineering team has begun work to fix the misconfiguration and redistribute the traffic.

45h:
Traffic was successfully redirected and the application was restored to full functionality. Root cause and solution:


The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration of the load balancer, resulting in a single backend server receiving a disproportionate amount of traffic. This server becomes overloaded, resulting in slow load times and errors for users. Misconfiguration is caused by a recent load balancer configuration change that has not been fully tested prior to deployment.

To resolve this issue, the engineering team fixed the load balancer configuration and redistributed the traffic evenly across all backend servers. Additionally, the team has implemented more robust testing procedures for future changes to prevent similar issues from occurring. Corrective and preventive action:


To prevent similar problems from occurring in the future, the following corrective and preventive actions have been identified:


- Develop a comprehensive test plan for all changes to the load balancer configuration.
- Set up automatic monitoring to detect and alert when misconfigured or unbalanced traffic.
- Increase the number of main servers to handle the spike in traffic.
- Create and document a formal incident response plan to streamline future incident response efforts.

Tasks to solve the problem:


- Fix the load balancer configuration to prevent the same configuration errors from happening in the future. - Set up automatic monitoring to detect and alert when misconfigured or unbalanced traffic.
- Add more main servers to handle spike in traffic.
- Develop and document a comprehensive test plan for all changes to the load balancer configuration.
- Create and document a formal incident response plan to streamline future incident response efforts.

To summarize, the May 4, 2023 outage was caused by a misconfiguration of the load balancer, resulting in slow load times, errors, and intermittent access for users. The issue was resolved by fixing the load balancer configuration and redistributing the traffic evenly across all core servers. To prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, a comprehensive inspection plan, automated monitoring, additional backend servers and a formal incident response plan will be implemented.Â
